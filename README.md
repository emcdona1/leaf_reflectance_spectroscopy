# Modelling with Leaf Reflectance Spectroscopy data

### Quickstart

1. Create an environment with Python 3.9, and install requirements (`pip -r requirements.txt`)
2. Execute `python start.py` and follow prompts in the terminal.
3. At the end of each program execution, the displayed results are saved
   to a folder called `results`.  The PNG contains the confusion matrix, and 
   the CSV file with the same name contains the performance summary (accuracy et al.).
